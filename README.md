# Forge MCP 1.4.7 compiled and ready to go!
This project contains the source for Forge and MCP for Minecraft 1.4.7!
The MCP in use here mcp7.26a.

The forge install errored on me when i tried to install the first time, therefore I had to remove the patches for RenderPlayer.java, SlotBrewingStandIngredient.java, and SlotArmor.java
This probably wont be any issue, however if you want them anyways, download forge src from https://files.minecraftforge.net and try to setup yourself.
